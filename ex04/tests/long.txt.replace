This is a test file to check the robustness of the program.
It contains various characters and whitespace patterns.

First, let's start with some special characters:
=*+#$%^&*

Now, let's include some whitespace variations:
Tabs:		Here is a tab.
Newlines:

Here is a newline.
Spaces:    Here are multiple spaces.

Let's mix special characters with whitespace:
= * + # $ % ^ & *	
    = * + # $ % ^ & *
= * + # $ % ^ & *	

Now, let's test the beginning and end of lines:
= * + # $ % ^ & * at the end
at the beginning = * + # $ % ^ & *

Finally, let's test the first and last lines:
First line with special characters: = * + # $ % ^ & *
Last line with special characters: = * + # $ % ^ & *

Repeated patterns:
abc abc abc abc abc

Mixed case sensitivity:
Case CASE case CaSe

Edge cases:
Empty line above
Special characters only: !
